The cavewoman has been around for all of my training presentations, she started by
inventing MAC addressing (for the fires she was selling*), and as time has gone on
she's invented IPv6, routing, backup, testing, automation, Ruby, Python, quality
engineering, intellectual property... Really she's a very prolific inventor who is
way ahead of her time.

* Really huge market opportunity, everybody wants one.  Nobody ever got fired for
buying cavewoman!
